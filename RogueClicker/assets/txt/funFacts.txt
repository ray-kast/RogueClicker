Are you colorblind?  The green is over there.
Try landing on the block next time.
Try landing on TOP of the blocks.
There is no cake down there.
Sorry - Anthony designed this level.
Seriously, I'm getting tired of watching you fail.
Please direct all level complaints to Anthony.
I'm sorry.
I enjoy hearing your screams.
Is the music too scary for you?

This isn't Skydiving Simulator 2015.
Why don't you just go back to Cookie Clicker?
There aren't trampolines down there.
Go home, you must be drunk.
Try not to fail this time.
Are you sure you want to be playing this?
Are you done abusing Spaceman yet?
Are you trying to be a rebel?
The goal is *not* to die...
You know, you're not even halfway done.
Chris could finish this level faster than you.
I bet an infinite number of monkeys could beat this game faster than you.
Oh, yeah, sure, it was the *lag* that killed you.
You didn't do the dew, did you?
Dude. Not cool.
Another one bites the space-dust.
It was the Illuminati.
The exit wasn't that way.
I'd prefer to be done before the next ice age.
Are you looking for easter eggs?
You just died.  Again.
You know, you could just give up now and save yourself the trouble.
Yes - we're sure you can beat this.  We playtested it.
This level has a 1% success rate.  I believe in you.
Are you sure you know the controls?
I am disappoint
<insert motivational poster>
You did that on purpose, didn't you.
Yes - that jump is possible.  I promise.
I'm getting annoyed just watching you.
We were originally going to add enemies.  Glad we didn't?
I used to believe in you.
Stop that.
PROTIP: Falling off the screen kills you.
No, the screen doesn't wrap around.
That was entertaining.
Git gud scrub
You got nifed #rekt
I'm tired of watching you die.
I'm running out of insults - please stop dying.
Don't worry - Ryan had to cheat on this level.  Damien didn't.
Come on, Zac could beat this on HIS laptop.

The crouton beat this level.
Only YOU can prevent forest fires.

All your lives are belong to us.
Russia has a better space program than this.
+1 Darwin Award!
Achievement Get: You died!
Do you know the definition of insanity?
You are teaching me new ways to die.
Git gud
You're wasting more clones than the galactic empire.
That was impressive, until you died.
That look on your face before you died, though...
Sorry, couldn't hear you over the sound of failure.
You know, that stunt almost worked.
The game didn't make you do that.
Take fifty...action!
That spaceman had a family, you know.
Once again, excellent work.
Very impressive.
Did you even try?
No one will blame you for giving up.
Hello?
What are you doing?
We made some of these levels easier. Aren't you glad?
Zac spent so much time on those animations just to watch you fail.
Uh oh.
Oh...you're still here?
